@inproceedings{ai-dlr-survey,
	abstract = {The possibilities to observe and interact with any
given spacecraft are naturally limited compared to groundbased systems due to a number of factors. These include but are
not limited to the availability and bandwidth of their connection
to ground, the availability of staff, communication latencies and
power budgets.
While a minimum level of autonomy is required for every spacecraft, past experiments and missions have shown that introducing more sophisticated autonomy mechanisms can drastically
increase the efficiency for many missions in terms of reliability,
science output and required operational effort.
Artificial intelligence poses an increasingly popular approach
for implementing on-board autonomy. The number of techniques and variants of artificial intelligence available in the
literature is, however, just as diversified as their potential field
of application. To provide an overview of the current state
of the art of artificial intelligence and its application for space
systems, this paper provides an extensive survey on existing
techniques and algorithms as well as existing and potential
applications on board spacecraft and on ground. The survey
focuses on autonomous planning and scheduling of operations,
self-awareness, anomaly detection and Fault Detection Isolation
and Recovery (FDIR), on-board data analysis as well as onboard operations and processing of earth-observation data.},

@article{mining-survey,
	abstract = {The development of an intelligent artificial satellite health monitoring system is a key issue in aerospace engineering that determines satellite health status and failure using telemetry data. The modern design of data mining and machine learning technologies allows the use of satellite telemetry data and the mining of integrated information to produce an advanced health monitoring system. This paper reviews the current status and presents a framework of necessary processes on data mining to solving various problems in telemetry data such as error detection, prediction, summarization, and visualization of large quantities, and help them understand the health status of the satellite and detect the symptoms of anomalies. Machine learning technologies that include neural networks, fuzzy sets, rough sets, support vector machines, Naive Bayesian, swarm optimization, and deep learning are also presented. Also, this paper reviews a wide range of existing satellite health monitoring solutions and discusses them in the framework of remote data mining techniques. In addition, we are discussing the analysis of space debris flow analysis and the prediction of low earth orbit collision based on our orbital Petri nets model. Challenges to be addressed and future directions of research are identified and an extensive bibliography is also included.},
